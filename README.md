## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12.7
- Network connectivity for multi-computer deployment

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hruday2111/byteSlayers.git
cd byteSlayers

## Usage

### Local Testing
1. Open multiple terminals
2. In each terminal run:
```bash
python P2P.py
```
3. Use `127.0.0.1` as IP and different ports (e.g., 5001, 5002, 5003)

### Network Deployment

#### Windows Firewall Setup
1. Open Windows Firewall (`wf.msc` or Control Panel)
2. Create Inbound Rule:
   - New Rule â†’ Program
   - Browse to Python executable
   - Allow connection
   - Enable for all networks
3. Repeat for Outbound Rule

#### Running the Application
1. Find your IP:
```bash
ipconfig   # Windows
ifconfig   # Linux/Mac
```

2. Start the application:
```bash
python P2P.py
